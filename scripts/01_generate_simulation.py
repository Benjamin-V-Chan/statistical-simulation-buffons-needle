# Define a function that simulates needle drops given:
#    - Number of trials
#    - Needle length
#    - Line spacing
#    - Random seed (optional)
# Generate needle drop positions randomly
# Compute intersections with lines
# Count the number of crossings
# Store results in a structured format (CSV or JSON)
# Save results in 'outputs/' folder
# Allow command-line execution with different parameters
