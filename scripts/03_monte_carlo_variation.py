# Define a function that applies Monte Carlo sampling with:
#    - Different distributions (uniform, normal, exponential)
#    - Varying line spacing and needle length ratios
# Simulate Buffonâ€™s Needle under these distributions
# Compute probability estimations based on Monte Carlo trials
# Save results in 'outputs/' for further analysis
